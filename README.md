# GAN Optimized Learning-Based View Synthesis for Light Field Cameras - Pytorch
A PyTorch implementation of a LF Camera View Synthesis method proposed by a SIGGRAPH Asia 2016 paper [Learning-Based View Synthesis for Light Field Cameras](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/LF/papers/SIGASIA16/).
Improved further with GAN proposed by a CVPR 2017 paper [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802).
## Requirments
- Python 3.x
- CUDA 8.0

## Other dependencies
- Pytorch
- openCV
- scipy
- numpy
- scikit-image
- matplotlib
- h5py
```angular2html
pip3 install -r requirments.txt
```
## Datasets

Training and test datasets are from [orginal project page](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/LF/papers/SIGASIA16/)

### Training Dataset
Training dataset has 100 light field images.
Download the Training set from [here](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/LF/papers/SIGASIA16/PaperData/SIGGRAPHAsia16_ViewSynthesis_Trainingset.zip),
unzip it and copy the png files in the `TrainingData/Training` directory.

### Test Dataset
Test dataset has 30 light field images.
Download the Test set from [here](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/LF/papers/SIGASIA16/PaperData/SIGGRAPHAsia16_ViewSynthesis_Testset.zip),
unzip it and copy the png files into `TrainingData/Test`  directory.

## Usage

### Train
Run "PrepareData.m" to process the training and test sets. It takes a long 
time for the first training image to be processed since a huge h5 file needs 
to be created first.
```
python3 prepare_data.py

``` 
Then start the training
```
python3 train_gan.py

optional arguments:
--is_continue                   if to continue training from existing network[default value is False]
```
The trained network, PSNR value and loss plot are in `TrainingData` directory.

### Test Single Image
Copy desired png files into `Scenes` folder. The results shown in the paper
can be found in `TestSet\PAPER` directory.
```
python3 test_gan.py
```
The output images and objective quality result are in `Results` directory.
